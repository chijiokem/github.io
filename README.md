## Interpretation 
From the Avg. Income per Purchase board, it shows that females who earn an average of $61,373 were more likely to buy bikes compared to their counterparts who earn an average of $66,818 and the men who earnes an average of $66,634 were less likely to buy a bike compared to their male counterparts who earn an average of $39,101. The reason for this discrepancy could be that since earning potential of a person seems to increasse with age, which means that the top earners might be people who are above 54years(old) and they find bike-riding a risky adventure to undertake.   
			From the customer age bracket board, it is obvious that middle agers patronized the bike business more than any other age bracket, this is probably because most of them will like to take their health seriously in the bid to live a healthy life or as recommended by a health professional.
